# RSA-Cryptosystem
This program, implemented in C++ allows user to securely data transmit data from one end to another. In this cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and it is different from the decryption key which is kept secret (private). Miller Rabin and Extended Euclid GCD algorithms have been inplemented for improved efficiency for secure data transmission
